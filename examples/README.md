# comfyui-ComfySnap Example Workflow

This directory contains example workflows demonstrating how to use comfyui-ComfySnap nodes effectively.

## Available Workflows

1. **ComfySnap.json** - A comprehensive demo showcasing all ComfySnap nodes including text overlays, filters, and effects.

## How to Use

1. Launch ComfyUI
2. Click the "Load" button in the ComfyUI interface
3. Navigate to and select the workflow JSON file
4. The workflow will be loaded with all nodes preconfigured
5. I use comfyui-impact-pack for face detection. You may need to download this if you don't have another face detection node. Otherwise, just delete the face detection node.

## Notes on Example Workflows
